이 풀이에서

맨처음에 select project_id from employee group by project_id having count(*) < 2 를 실행하면
20이 나옴 여기서 헤깔릴수잇는데 조건이 2개가 미만인거니까 카운트가 1인 20만 나와야됨

그러면 이제 
select name from project p where p.project_id in (20) 을 하면
beta가 나옴

그러면 
from employee as e join project as p on e.project_id = p.project_id
where p.name in (gamma) 를 하면

답은 1
 만약 having count(*) >= 2 였으면
10이나오고 그러면 값이 alpha,  beta가 있으니까 중복조인에 의해
값이 4여야됨
